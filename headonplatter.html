       <b><h1> Head on the Patter</h1>
         </b> 
         <p>Put your head though the hole in the table and look at the mirrors on the wall. The mirrors on the side of the table reflect the pattern of the floor tiles and the walls producing the illusion that your body is missing! ... This optical illusion uses mirrors to create the effect that you have lost your head.
